   **Properties:**

   **Magic methods:**

.. seq:function:: median[T](data : List[T])

   
       Return the median (middle value) of numeric data.
   
       When the number of data points is odd, return the middle data point.
       When the number of data points is even, the median is interpolated by
       taking the average of the two middle values
   



.. seq:function:: median_low[T](data : List[T])

   
       Return the low median of numeric data.
   
       When the number of data points is odd, the middle value is returned.
       When it is even, the smaller of the two middle values is returned.
   



.. seq:function:: median_high[T](data : List[T])

   
       Return the high median of data.
   
       When the number of data points is odd, the middle value is returned.
       When it is even, the larger of the two middle values is returned.
   



.. seq:function:: median_grouped[T, S](data : List[T], interval : S = 1)

   
       Return the 50th percentile (median) of grouped continuous data.
   



.. seq:function:: mode[T](data : List[T])

   
       Return the most common data point from discrete or nominal data.
   



.. seq:function:: multimode[T](data : List[T])

   
       Return a list of the most frequently occurring values.
   
       Will return more than one result if there are multiple modes
       or an empty list if *data* is empty.
   



.. seq:function:: quantiles[T](data : List[T], n : int = 4, method : str = "exclusive")

   
       Divide *data* into *n* continuous intervals with equal probability.
   
       Returns a list of (n - 1) cut points separating the intervals.
   
       Set *n* to 4 for quartiles (the default).  Set *n* to 10 for deciles.
       Set *n* to 100 for percentiles which gives the 99 cuts points that
       separate *data* in to 100 equal sized groups.
   
       The *data* can be any iterable containing sample.
       The cut points are linearly interpolated between data points.
   
       If *method* is set to *inclusive*, *data* is treated as population
       data.  The minimum value is treated as the 0th percentile and the
       maximum value is treated as the 100th percentile.
   



.. seq:function:: mean(data : List[float])

   
       Return the sample arithmetic mean of data.
   
       TODO/CAVEATS
         - Assumes input is floats
         - Does not address NAN or INF
   



.. seq:function:: geometric_mean(data : List[float])

   
       Convert data to floats and compute the geometric mean.
   
       Raises a StatisticsError if the input dataset is empty,
   
       TODO/CAVEATS:
         - Assumes input is a list of floats
         - Uses mean instead of fmean for now
         - Does not handle data that contains a zero, or if it contains a negative value.
   



.. seq:function:: harmonic_mean(data : List[float])

   
       Return the harmonic mean of data.
   
       The harmonic mean, sometimes called the subcontrary mean, is the
       reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the data,
       and is often appropriate when averaging quantities which are rates
       or ratios.
   



.. seq:function:: pvariance(data : List[float], mu : Optional[float] = None)

   
       Return the population variance of `data`.
   
       Should contain atleast one value.
       The optional argument mu, if given, should be the mean of
       the data. If it is missing or None, the mean is automatically calculated.
   
       TODO/CAVEATS:
         - Assumes input is a list of floats
   



.. seq:function:: pstdev(data : List[float], mu : Optional[float] = None)

   
       Return the square root of the population variance.
   



.. seq:function:: variance(data : List[float], xbar : Optional[float] = None)

   
       Return the sample variance of data.
   
       Shoulw contain atleast two values.
       The optional argument xbar, if given, should be the mean of
       the data. If it is missing or None, the mean is automatically calculated.

       Return the square root of the sample variance.

                    If *other* is a NormalDist, add both the means and the variances.
                    Mathematically, this works only if the two distributions are
