   Parser for command line options.
   
   This module helps scripts to parse the command line arguments in
   sys.argv.  It supports the same conventions as the Unix getopt()
   function (including the special meanings of arguments of the form `-'
   and `--').  Long options similar to those supported by GNU software
   may be used as well via an optional third argument.  This module
   provides two functions and an exception:
   
   getopt() -- Parse command line options
   gnu_getopt() -- Like getopt(), but allow option and non-option arguments
   to be intermixed.
   GetoptError -- exception (class) raised with 'opt' attribute, which is the
   option involved with the exception.

       Parses command line options and parameter list.  args is the
       argument list to be parsed, without the leading reference to the
       running program.  Typically, this means "sys.argv[1:]".  shortopts
       is the string of option letters that the script wants to
       recognize, with options that require an argument followed by a
       colon (i.e., the same format that Unix getopt() uses).  If
       specified, longopts is a list of strings with the names of the
       long options which should be supported.  The leading '--'
       characters should not be included in the option name.  Options
       which require an argument should be followed by an equal sign
       ('=').
   
       The return value consists of two elements: the first is a list of
       (option, value) pairs; the second is the list of program arguments
       left after the option list was stripped (this is a trailing slice
       of the first argument).  Each option-and-value pair returned has
       the option as its first element, prefixed with a hyphen (e.g.,
       '-x'), and the option argument as its second element, or an empty
       string if the option has no argument.  The options occur in the
       list in the same order in which they were found, thus allowing
       multiple occurrences.  Long and short options may be mixed.
   
       NOTES:
       This function works like the above-mentioned getopt(), except that GNU style scanning
       mode is used by default. This means that option and non-option
       arguments may be intermixed. The getopt() function stops
       processing options as soon as a non-option argument is
       encountered.
       If the first character of the option string is `+', or if the
       environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, then option
       processing stops as soon as a non-option argument is encountered.
